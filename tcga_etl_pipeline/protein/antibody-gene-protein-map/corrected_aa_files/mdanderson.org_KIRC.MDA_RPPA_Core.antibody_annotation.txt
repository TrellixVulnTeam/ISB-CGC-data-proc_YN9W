MET	c-Met-M-C_GBL9016800.txt	c-Met-M-C	**Used for QC**	Mouse	CST	3127	Met, a high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, also known as scatter factor) is a disulfide-linked heterodimer made of 45 kDa ?- and 145 kDa ?-subunits. The ?-subunit and the amino-terminal region of the ?-subunit form the extracellular domain. The remainder of the ?-chain spans the plasma membrane and contains a cytoplasmic region with tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of Met with HGF results in autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosines, which recruit several downstream signaling components, including Gab1, c-Cbl, and PI3 kinase. These fundamental events are important for all of the biological functions involving Met kinase activity. The addition of a phosphate at cytoplasmic Tyr1003 is essential for Met protein ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1234/1235 in the Met kinase domain is critical for kinase activation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1349 in the Met cytoplasmic domain provides a direct binding site for Gab1. Research studies have shown that altered Met levels and/or tyrosine kinase activities are found in several types of tumors, including renal, colon, and breast. Thus, investigators have concluded that Met is an attractive potential cancer therapeutic and diagnostic target.	c-Met

Upon activation by mitogenic and/or stress stimuli mediated by Erk and p38 MAPK, Mnk1 phosphorylates eIF4E at Ser209 in vivo (3,4). Two Erk and p38 MAPK phosphorylation sites in mouse Mnk1 (Thr197 and Thr202) are essential for Mnk1 kinase activity (3). The carboxy-terminal region of eIF4G also contains serum-stimulated phosphorylation sites, including Ser1108, Ser1148, and Ser1192 (5). Phosphorylation at these sites is blocked by the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 and by the FRAP/mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.	eIF4E

MET	c-Met-M-QC_GBL1115829.txt	c-Met-M-QC	**Used for QC**	Mouse	CST	3127	Met, a high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, also known as scatter factor) is a disulfide-linked heterodimer made of 45 kDa ?- and 145 kDa ?-subunits. The ?-subunit and the amino-terminal region of the ?-subunit form the extracellular domain. The remainder of the ?-chain spans the plasma membrane and contains a cytoplasmic region with tyrosine kinase activity. Interaction of Met with HGF results in autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosines, which recruit several downstream signaling components, including Gab1, c-Cbl, and PI3 kinase. These fundamental events are important for all of the biological functions involving Met kinase activity. The addition of a phosphate at cytoplasmic Tyr1003 is essential for Met protein ubiquitination and degradation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1234/1235 in the Met kinase domain is critical for kinase activation. Phosphorylation at Tyr1349 in the Met cytoplasmic domain provides a direct binding site for Gab1. Research studies have shown that altered Met levels and/or tyrosine kinase activities are found in several types of tumors, including renal, colon, and breast. Thus, investigators have concluded that Met is an attractive potential cancer therapeutic and diagnostic target.	c-Met-M-QC

PARP1	PARP1-R-V_GBL1115798.txt	PARP1-R-V	Valid	Rabbit	Santa Cruz	sc-7150	Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), also designated PARP, is a nuclear DNA-binding zinc finger protein that influences DNA repair, DNA replication, modulation of chromatin structure, and apoptosis. In response to genotoxic stress, PARP-1 catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose units from NAD(+) to a number of acceptor molecules including chromatin. PARP-1 recognizes DNA strand interruptions and can complex with RNA and negatively regulate transcription. Actinomycin D- and etoposide-dependent induction of caspases mediates cleavage of PARP-1 into a p89 fragment that traverses into the cytoplasm. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus is PARP-1-dependent and is necessary for PARP-1-dependent cell death. PARP-1 deficiencies lead to chromosomal instability due to higher frequencies of chromosome fusions and aneuploidy, suggesting that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation contributes to the efficient maintenance of genome integrity. PARP-2 is part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, catalyzing the poly(ADP-ribosy)lation of nuclear proteins. PARP-2 is a nuclear, DNA-binding protein which interacts with PARP-1. PARP-2 is present in actively dividing tissues with highest levels in the kidney, skeletal muscle, liver, heart and spleen.	PARP1
PARP1	PARP_cleaved-M-QC_GBL1115821.txt	PARP_cleaved-M-QC	**Used for QC**	Mouse	CST	9546	PARP, a 116 kDa nuclear poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, appears to be involved in DNA repair in response to environmental stress. This protein can be cleaved by many ICE-like caspases in vitro and is one of the main cleavage targets of caspase-3 in vivo. In human PARP, the cleavage occurs between Asp214 and Gly215, which separates the PARP amino-terminal DNA binding domain (24 kDa) from the carboxy-terminal catalytic domain (89 kDa). PARP helps cells to maintain their viability; cleavage of PARP facilitates cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis.	PARP_cleaved-M-QC

SETD2	SETD2-R-QC_GBL1115758.txt	SETD2-R-QC	**Used for QC**	Rabbit	Abcam	ab69836	SETD2 is a Histone methyltransferase that methylates 'Lys-36' of histone H3. H3 'Lys-36' methylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. Probably plays a role in chromatin structure modulation during elongation via its interaction with hyperphosphorylated POLR2A. Binds DNA at promoters. May also act as a transcription activator that binds to promoters. Binds to the promoters of adenovirus 12 E1A gene in case of infection, possibly leading to regulate its expression.	SETD2-R-QC

DIABLO	Smac-M-QC_GBL1115825.txt	Smac-M-QC	**Used for QC**	Mouse	CST	2954	Smac/Diablo is a 21 kDa mammalian mitochondrial protein that functions as a regulatory component during apoptosis. Upon mitochondrial stress, Smac/Diablo is released from mitochondria and competes with caspases for binding of IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins). The interaction of Smac/Diablo with IAPs relieves the inhibitory effect of the IAPs on caspases. This interaction involves mainly the amino-terminal residues of Smac/Diablo with the BIR3 region of XIAP, supplemented with several other hydrophobic interactions between the helical structures of Smac/Diablo and other areas of BIR3.

SNAI1	Snail-M-QC_GBL1115826.txt	Snail-M-QC	**Used for QC**	Mouse	CST	3895	Snail is a zinc-finger transcription factor that can repress E-cadherin transcription. Downregulation of E-cadherin is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition during embryonic development, a process also exploited by invasive cancer cells. Indeed, loss of E-cadherin expression is correlated with the invasive properties of some tumors and there is a considerable inverse correlation between Snail and E-cadherin mRNA levels in epithelial tumor cell lines. In addition, Snail blocks the cell cycle and confers resistance to cell death. Phosphorylation of Snail by GSK-3 and PAK1 regulates its stability, cellular localization and function.	Snail-M-QC
